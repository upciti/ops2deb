# ops2deb

Are you tired of checking if your favorite devops tools are up-to-date? Are you using a debian based GNU/Linux distribution?
`ops2deb` is designed to generate Debian packages for common devops tools such as kubectl, kustomize, helm, ...,
but can be used to package any portable application. In short, it consumes a configuration file and outputs `.deb` packages.
`ops2deb` can also track new releases of upstream applications and automatically bump application versions in its configuration file.

## Installation

### With [wakemeops](https://docs.wakemeops.com)

```shell
sudo apt-get install ops2deb
```

### With [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx)

```shell
pipx install ops2deb
```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.9 if installed with `pip` or `pipx`
- To build debian packages with `ops2deb build` you need the following packages on your host:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential fakeroot debhelper
```

If you plan to build packages for `armhf` and `arm64` you will also need the following packages:

```shell
sudo apt install binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

## Getting started

In a test directory run:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upciti/ops2deb/main/ops2deb.yml
ops2deb generate
ops2deb build
```

To check for new releases run:

```shell
ops2deb update
```

This command updates each blueprint in the `ops2deb.yml` configuration file with the latest version of the upstream application.

By default `ops2deb` caches downloaded content in `/tmp/ops2deb_cache`:

```shell
tree /tmp/ops2deb_cache
```

The cache can be flushed with:

```shell
ops2deb purge
```

For more information about existing subcommands and options run `ops2deb --help`.

## Usage examples

### Packaging `kubectl`

```yaml
name: kubectl
version: 1.20.1
summary: command line client for controlling a Kubernetes cluster
description: |
  kubectl is a command line client for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.
fetch:
  url: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v{{version}}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
  sha256: 3f4b52a8072013e4cd34c9ea07e3c0c4e0350b227e00507fb1ae44a9adbf6785
script:
  - mv kubectl {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

### Creating a metapackage

Ops2deb can be used to create [metapackages](https://www.debian.org/blends/hamradio/get/metapackages):

```yaml
name: allthethings
version: 0.1.9
arch: all
summary: install various devops tools
description: Some great description.
depends:
  - kubectl
  - kustomize
  - helm
  - helmfile
  - devspace
```

### Packaging ops2deb with ops2deb

Note that when the fetch key is not used, ops2deb will run the build script from the directory where it was called.
Hence for the following blueprint to succeed, you have to run ops2deb from the root directory of this github project.

```yaml
name: ops2deb
version: 0.15.0
homepage: https://github.com/upciti/ops2deb
summary: debian packaging tool for portable applications
description: |-
  Ops2deb is primarily designed to easily generate Debian packages for portable
  applications such as single binary applications and scripts. Packages are
  described using a simple configuration file format. Ops2deb can track new
  releases of upstream applications and automatically bump application versions
  in its configuration file.
script:
  - poetry install -E pyinstaller
  - poetry run task single_binary_application
  - install -m 755 build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/install/ops2deb {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

### Building packages for multiple architectures at once

If the maintainers of the application you wish to package publish releases for mutliple architectures, `ops2deb` can generate one package per architecture from a single blueprint:

```yaml
name: helm
version: 3.7.2
homepage: https://helm.sh/
summary: Kubernetes package manager
description: |-
  Tool for managing Kubernetes charts.
  Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
depends:
  - kubectl
fetch:
  url: https://get.helm.sh/helm-v{{version}}-linux-{{goarch}}.tar.gz
  sha256:
    amd64: 4ae30e48966aba5f807a4e140dad6736ee1a392940101e4d79ffb4ee86200a9e
    armhf: ab73727f1c00903aff010a3557ab4366a1a13ce2d243c9cb191e703fbb76c915
    arm64: b0214eabbb64791f563bd222d17150ce39bf4e2f5de49f49fdb456ce9ae8162f
script:
  - mv linux-*/helm {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

The blueprint above will generate three packages: `helm_3.7.2-1~ops2deb_armhf.deb`, `helm_3.7.2-1~ops2deb_arm64.deb` and `helm_3.7.2-1~ops2deb_amd64.deb`

Note the use of the `{{goarch}}` variable which maps debian architectures to sensible go architectures.

You can also define your own architure maps using the `fetch.targets` field and the `{{target}}` jinja variable:

```yaml
name: bottom
version: 0.6.6
homepage: https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom
revision: 2
summary: cross-platform graphical process/system monitor
description: |-
  A cross-platform graphical process/system monitor with a customizable interface
  and a multitude of features. Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  Inspired by gtop, gotop, and htop.
fetch:
  url: https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases/download/{{version}}/bottom_{{target}}.tar.gz
  sha256:
    amd64: 37ed4570d881f52784ed4780430c1f8c0d9132167e61306071d3ba09c49c0ca0
    armhf: 7f3fb6d80de982b9ae3d7b4dfdfb640e838ba89ac0e7ff6d23ffffb1eae3b66c
  targets:
    amd64: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    armhf: armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
script:
  - mv btm {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

### Using environment variables

You can use `{{env("VARIABLE", "a_default")}}` in all fields except `fetch.sha256` and `fetch.targets.*`.
The example below uses environment variables set by Gitlab CI:

```yaml
name: "{{env('CI_PROJECT_NAME')}}"
version: "{{env('CI_COMMIT_TAG', '0')}}"
homepage: "{{env('CI_PROJECT_URL')}}"
summary: awesome application for doing things
description: |-
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
  nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
script:
  - install -m 755 build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/install/great-app {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

## Configuration file

Written in YAML and composed of a single blueprint object or a list of blueprints objects. A blueprint is defined by the following:

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                                                     | Default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |

| `revision`    | Package revistion.                                                                                                                          | `1`     |
| `summary`     | Package short description.                                                                                                                  |         |

| `fetch`       | A binary to download, and a `sha256` checksum. `tar.gz`, `tar.xz`, `tar` and `zip` (requires `unzip`) archives are extracted automatically. | `Null`  |
| `script`      | List of build instructions templated with jinja2 and intepreted with the default `shell`.                                                   | `[]`    |
| `depends`     | List of package dependencies. Corresponds to `Depends` entry in `debian/control`.                                                           | `[]`    |
| `recommends`  | List of package recommended dependencies. Corresponds to `Recommends` entry in `debian/control`.                                            | `[]`    |
| `conflicts`   | List of conflicting packages. Corresponds to `Conflicts` entry in `debian/control`.                                                         | `[]`    |

## Development

You will need [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and probably [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) if you don't have python 3.9 on your host.

```shell
poetry install
```

To run ops2deb test suite run:

```shell
poetry run task check
```

To build a python wheel:

```shell
poetry run poetry build
```

Note that the `poetry run` is important to enable [poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning)
which is installed as a dev dependency.

To build a single binary applicatin:

Install required build dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install binutils python3-dev
poetry install -E pyinstaller
```

And run:

```shell
poetry run task single_binary_application
```

## Important notes

`ops2deb` **DOES NOT** sandbox build instructions so if you do something like:

```shell
script:
- rm -rf ~/*
```

You will loose your files... To make sure that you won't mess with your system, run it within a container.
