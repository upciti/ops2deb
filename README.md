# ops2deb

Are you tired of checking if your favorite devops tools are up-to-date? Are you using a debian based GNU/Linux distribution?
`ops2deb` is designed to generate Debian packages for common devops tools such as kubectl, kustomize, helm, ...,
but it could be used to package any statically linked application. In short, it consumes a configuration file and outputs `.deb` packages.

## Configuration file

Written in YAML and composed of a list of package blueprints. A blueprint is defined by the following:

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                                                     | Default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `name`        | Component name, e.g. `kustomize`.                                                                                                           |         |
| `version`     | Application release to package.                                                                                                             |         |
| `homepage`    | Upstream project homepage.                                                                                                                  | `None`  |
| `arch`        | Package architecture.                                                                                                                       | `amd64` |
| `revision`    | Package revistion.                                                                                                                          | `1`     |
| `summary`     | Package short description.                                                                                                                  |         |
| `description` | Package full description.                                                                                                                   |         |
| `fetch`       | A binary to download, and a `sha256` checksum. `tar.gz`, `tar.xz`, `tar` and `zip` (requires `unzip`) archives are extracted automatically. | `Null`  |
| `script`      | List of build instructions templated with jinja2 and intepreted with the default `shell`.                                                   | `[]`    |
| `depends`     | List of package dependencies. Corresponds to `Depends` entry in `debian/control`.                                                           | `[]`    |
| `recommends`  | List of package recommended dependencies. Corresponds to `Recommends` entry in `debian/control`.                                            | `[]`    |
| `conflicts`   | List of conflicting packages. Corresponds to `Conflicts` entry in `debian/control`.                                                         | `[]`    |

Example:

```yaml
- name: kubectl
  version: 1.20.1
  summary: Command line client for controlling a Kubernetes cluster
  description: |
    kubectl is a command line client for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.
  fetch:
    url: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v{{version}}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
    sha256: 3f4b52a8072013e4cd34c9ea07e3c0c4e0350b227e00507fb1ae44a9adbf6785
  script:
    - mv kubectl {{src}}/usr/bin/
```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.9
- To build debian packages with `ops2deb build` you need the following packages on your host:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential fakeroot debhelper
```

## Usage example

Install `ops2deb` in a virtualenv or with [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx)

```shell
pipx install ops2deb
```

Then, in a test directory run:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upciti/ops2deb/main/ops2deb.yml
ops2deb generate
ops2deb build
```

To check for new releases run:

```shell
ops2deb update
```

`ops2deb` uses temp directories to cache downloaded binaries and to run build instructions:

```shell
tree /tmp/ops2deb_*
```

The cache can be flushed with:

```shell
ops2deb purge
```

## Development

You will need [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```shell
poetry install
poetry run task check
```

## Important notes

`ops2deb` **DOES NOT** sandbox build instructions so if you do something like:

```shell
script:
- rm -rf ~/*
```

You will loose your files... To make sure that you won't mess with your system, run it within a container.
